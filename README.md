## About Me

I am an IT undergraduate focused on building modern, secure web applications.

My current focus is mastering the TanStack ecosystem (Query, Router, Table) and strengthening my understanding of React, Next.js, and TypeScript-driven frontend architecture. I am particularly interested in how data flows through applications — caching, synchronization, and state management — and how to design systems that are both scalable and secure.

Alongside web development, I actively study cybersecurity and ethical hacking, with a strong interest in secure coding practices, authentication systems, and application-layer security.

I aim to understand tools deeply — not just how to use them, but why they work.
